    <h3>Habit Tracker</h3>
    <p>Habit Tracker is an application based off of the ideas in Steve Kamb's book: Level Up Your Life.</p>
    <p>The idea is to live out the hero's journey yourself by becoming the character you want to be.</p>
    <p>You are writing the story of your life, and this application is a tool to help you make that story a reality.</p>
    <p>If you want to be Batman, this application will make you consider what you will need to do to become Batman in real life.</p>
    <p>Choose a hero and set off on your journey!</p>

    <h3>My Character</h3>
    <p>A representation of where you are in your journey and how far you are from the final version of your character.</p>
    <p>Currently under development</p>

  <section id="goals">
    <h3>Goals</h3>
    <p>The skills and accomplishments the final version of your character has reached.</p>
    <p>The idea is that whatever the final version of your character is capable of doing is what your goals will be. So go wild and aim high!</p>
    <p>In addition to goals, you can add subgoals underneath a goal to break it up into more manageable pieces.</p>
